https://github.com/vienpt/word-office-js/blob/main/vite.config.mts - Vite setup guide that I partially followed

When deploying once check the build where the taskpane.html files are generated as in viteconfig you have specified rollup input options so they may be in dist
not dist/taskpane you have to update the urls in manifest or just remove the vite config rollup input
